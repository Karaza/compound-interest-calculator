# Compound Interest Calculator

Today we will build a Coumpound Interest Calculator. But what is a compound interest?

- Let's say you have 1000€ on your bank account.
- Each month you save 200€ and add this amount to your bank account.
- In addition to this saving, you receive each month 2% interest (not bad!) for the amount on your account.
- And so on, month after month...

## Example

The first month, you will have 1000€ on your bank account. The second month you will have 1000€ + 200€ (your monthly saving) + 20€ (the monthly benefit) The third month, you will have 1220€ + 200€ + 2% of 1220€...

## To Do

The React app should contain a form with four inputs to let the user choose:

- The initial amount on the bank account
- The amount of the monthly saving
- The interest rate
- The duration (in months) from today

Finally, the app sould render one line for each month with these values:

- Month name and year
- Amount on the bank account
- Amount of the monthly interest
